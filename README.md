## Setup Instructions

1. Add your Telegram token to an `.env` file:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual Telegram bot token:
     ```
     TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
     ```

2. Run the `run.sh` script to start the application:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```
     ./run.sh
     ```

This will start the application with the configured Telegram bot token.
